# Welcome to Abby, Your Personal Voice Assistant!

## Overview

This script creates a voice-controlled assistant, Abby, which uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model for text-based conversation and employs Google's Speech Recognition API for speech-to-text conversion. The assistant can be controlled through verbal commands and is capable of carrying out an ongoing conversation with the user.

### Key Features

1. **Triggered Activation:** Abby can be activated by saying "hey Abby", initiating an interaction.
2. **Continuous Conversation:** Abby can carry out ongoing conversations with the user, understanding context from previous responses.
3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Systems:** Abby uses AWS Polly or pyttsx3 as the Text-to-Speech engine, configurable in the settings.
4. **Interactive Response:** Abby can respond with different phrases depending on the context and the input from the user.
5. **Program Termination:** Abby can be instructed to stop by saying "goodbye Abby".

## Getting Started

### Installation

This program requires several Python libraries to be installed. Please make sure to install the following:

```sh
pip install os
pip install time
pip install random
pip install keyboard
pip install threading
pip install configparser
pip install pygame
pip install winsound
pip install boto3
pip install pyttsx3
pip install speech_recognition
pip install python-dotenv
```

You will also need to install OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

### Running the Program

To run the program, execute the python script with:

```sh
python script_name.py
```

### Customizing Abby

To customize Abby's settings such as AWS credentials, user information, system prompts, voice selection, TTS engine, and microphone device index, you can edit the configuration in `config.txt`. You can also customize Abby's responses by editing the phrases in `thinking_messages.txt`.

## Detailed Functionality

### 1. Abby's Speech Recognition

Abby uses Google's Speech Recognition API to convert the user's spoken commands into text. 

### 2. Abby's Text to Speech

Abby can use either AWS Polly or pyttsx3 as the TTS engine, configured in `config.txt`.

### 3. Abby's AI Chat Functionality

Abby uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate responses to the user's text commands. 

### 4. User Interaction

Abby can be activated by saying "hey Abby", and deactivated by saying "goodbye Abby". During a conversation, Abby will continuously listen for the user's commands and generate responses.

### 5. Conversation History

Abby has the ability to retain the context of the current conversation. She maintains the history of the last 9 messages exchanged between the user and herself during a single run of the program. This enables a more cohesive and engaging interaction by allowing Abby to generate responses that take into account prior exchanges.

However, it's important to note that the conversation history is ephemeral and is reset when the program is terminated. This means that every new run of the program starts with a fresh conversation without any context from previous sessions.

Future improvements to Abby will include persisting conversation history to a local database. This will allow the continuation of interactions across different runs of the program, enabling an even more seamless and persistent user experience.

## Troubleshooting

If Abby isn't responding correctly, please ensure that your microphone is properly configured and that the Google Speech Recognition API is accessible.
